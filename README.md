## Technical Overview

### Why Flutter and Dart?
- **Cross-Platform Development**: Flutter allows us to develop for both Android and iOS from a single codebase, saving time and resources.
- **Fast Development**: Features like Hot Reload and a rich set of pre-designed widgets enable rapid prototyping and iteration.
- **Performance**: Dartâ€™s JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation aids in development speed, while AOT (Ahead-Of-Time) compilation ensures high performance in production builds.

### Dart Compilation
- **JIT Compilation**: Enhances development speed with quick reload times, allowing developers to see changes in real-time.
- **AOT Compilation**: Compiles the code ahead of time for optimized performance, crucial for a smooth user experience in production.

## Challenges Faced
- **State Management**: Managing the state of various form inputs and ensuring data integrity across the application.
- **Form Validation**: Implementing robust validation to ensure all necessary data is collected accurately.
- **QR Code Generation and Display**: Ensuring QR codes are generated correctly and displayed properly within the app.
- **Route Management**: Navigating between different pages and ensuring a seamless user experience.

## Future Enhancements
- **User Authentication**: Adding user login and authentication to secure access to personal data.
- **Notifications**: Implementing push notifications to remind students of their requests and updates.
- **Data Persistence**: Ensuring that all data is saved and can be accessed offline.
